# Contributing

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/express-ipfilter.git

Install the dependencies:

    npm install

**Add tests** for your change. Make sure the tests pass:

    npm test

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests.
We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
